- 👋 Hi, I’m Ionut!

- 👀 I’m interested mostly in Web Development, but programming in general. It's my passion since High-School. I have a big desire to improve my skills and I am interested in any collaboration that gives me the opportunity to do so!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning to become a more skilled Frontend Developer by working in real projects with senior programmers, developing projects by myself (Check my work. I am continuously updating).
I am currently skilled in #HTML #CSS #Bootstrap #Javascript #Git&Github. I have also learnt C++ for over 2 years and worked also with C and Python.
I am also improving my skills via Udemy and Freecodecamp courses. I am accomplishing some of their courses and earning certifications. You can check the credentials below.
