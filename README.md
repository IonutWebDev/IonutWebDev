- 👋 Hi, I’m Ionut!

Here's some information about my skills:
- 🌱 Driven by a passion for IT since high school, I excel in C, Python, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap. My academic background in web development, coupled with hands-on experience,
        equips me to thrive in both backend and frontend roles. In my current job position, in my team and not only, I lead the development and maintenance of automation scripts in Python, addressing departmental needs and ensuring project milestones were met.
        I'm adept at analyzing requirements, crafting solutions, and collaborating effectively within multidisciplinary teams.
        With a proactive problem-solving approach and a commitment to innovation, I'm poised to contribute to impactful projects in backend and frontend development roles.
